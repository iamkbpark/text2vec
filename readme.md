# Features

**text2vec** is a package that provides an efficient framework with a concise API for text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) in R. It is inspired by [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), an excellent Python library for NLP.

The core functionality at the moment includes

1. Fast text vectorization on arbitrary n-grams, using vocabulary or feature hashing.
2. State-of-the-art [GloVe](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) word embeddings.

The core of this package is carefully written in C++, which means text2vec is fast and memory friendly. Some parts (GloVe training) are fully parallelized using the excellent [RcppParallel](http://rcppcore.github.io/RcppParallel/) package. This means that parallel processing works on OS X, Linux, Windows and Solaris (x86) without any additional hacking or tricks. In addition, there is a higher-level parallelization for text vectorization and vocabulary construction on top of the [foreach](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) package, and text2vec has a streaming API so that users don't have to load all of the data into RAM.

The API is built around the [iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator) abstraction. The API is concise, providing only a few functions which do their job well. The package does not (and probably will not in the future) provide trivial very high-level functions. But other packages can build on top of the framework that text2vec provides.

# Contributing
